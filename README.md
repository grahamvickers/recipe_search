# Graham Vickers Recipe Search

With this application I have created a food recipe and blog website, my assignment was to create a live search to display content from a sql database and display them in real time. I have chose to integrate a recipe search for my users to be able to find recipes in real time and get smokin' right away!


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

You will need to install the following in order to run the website:

copy and paste the following into your terminal: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/grahamvickers/recipe_search
```

#### Deployment 

Then open the project folder in a terminal of your choice, then copy and paste the following and go.
```
$ docker-compose up
```
Then go to - [localhost:3042](https://localhost:3042) - in a web broswer of your choice and start searching recipes!
